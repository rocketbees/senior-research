## The Blender Game Engine is a Slow Mess, But I'm Not Giving Up On It

Blender is a free and open source computer graphics software that features an integrated game engine. This game engine currently does not perform with the same standard of efficiency as comparable commercial game engines. The objective of this project is to develop a method to optimize the Blender game engine in a way that will improve graphical performance, as well as investigate current research into this endevour. Optimization of the game engine would be a valuable addition to the software and make Blender a more viable software option for developers on a limited budget.
